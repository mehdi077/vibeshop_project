Instead of syncing code to a Convex dev deployment hosted in the cloud, you can
develop against a deployment running on your own computer. You can even use the
Convex dashboard with local deployments!

## Background on Deployments in Convex

Each Convex deployment contains its own data, functions, scheduled functions,
etc. A project has one production deployment, one cloud deployment for
development per team member, and potentially many transient
[preview deployments](/docs/testing.mdx).

Running the deployment you're syncing code to during development on your own
machine makes code sync faster and means resources like functions calls and
database bandwidth don't count against
[the quotas for your Convex plan](https://www.convex.dev/pricing).

Local deployments are not recommended for production use: they're development
deployments, i.e. logs for function results and full stack traces for error
responses are sent to connected clients. For information about self-hosting a
production deployment instead, see the
[convex-backend GitHub repo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend).

## Using local deployments

<BetaAdmonition feature="Local deployments" verb="are" />

While using local deployments, the local Convex backend runs as a subprocess of
the `npx convex dev` command and exits when that command is stopped. This means
a `convex dev` command must be running in order to run other commands like
`npx convex run` against this local deployment.

State for local backends is stored the `~/.convex/convex-backend-state/`
directory.

### Using a Local Deployments for a New Project

When creating a new project you can choose to start out with local development
right away by choosing this option during project creation.

In addition to downloading the Convex backend binary and pushing your code to
it, this command updates the `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable in your
`.env.local` file so clients like webapps you're developing and Convex CLI
commands like `npx convex dev` and `npx convex run` know to use the local
deployment.

### Enabling for an Existing Project

To use a local deployment for an existing project, run:

```sh
npx convex dev --local --once
```

You'll also always be given the option for a local deployment if you run
`npx convex dev --configure --ask`. Other flows may assume you want a cloud
deployment in some situations, for example when connecting to a project for
which you already have a cloud development deployment.

### Disabling

To stop using local developments for a project, run the following:

```sh
npx convex disable-local-dev
```

Remember your cloud dev deployment and each local dev deployment are completely
separate, so contain different data. When switching between deployments you may
wish to [export and re-import](/database/import-export/import-export.mdx) the
data to keep using it.

## Limitations

- **No Public URL** - Cloud deployments have public URL to receive incoming HTTP
  requests from services like Twilio, but local deployments listen for HTTP
  requests on your own computer. Similarly, you can't power websites with Convex
  WebSocket connections unless your users browsers know how to reach your
  computer. Set up a proxy like ngrok or use a cloud deployment for these uses
  cases.

- **Node actions require specific Node.js versions** - Running Node.js actions
  (actions defined in files with `"use node;"`) requires having Node.js 18
  installed, since this is the version of Node.js used in production when
  Node.js actions run in AWS Lambda functions. To resolve this you can install
  and set up [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and then install Node.js
  version 18. You don't need to use Node.js 18 for the rest of your project.

- **Node.js actions run directly on your computer** - Like a normal Node.js
  server, code running in Node.js actions has unrestricted filesystem access.
  Queries, mutations, and Convex runtime actions still run in isolated
  environments.

- Logs get cleared out every time a `npx convex dev` command is restarted.
