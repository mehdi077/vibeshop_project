If you're excited about self-hosting, you can run the Convex backend on your own
servers. Self-hosted Convex runs the
[open-source backend](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend), and
contains the same fully up-to-date code the cloud service uses.

To get started with self hosting, follow the
[self hosting guide](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend/blob/main/self-hosted/README.md)
in the repository. Join the `#self-hosted` channel in the
[Discord community](https://convex.dev/community) for self-hosting support.

Self hosting is not for everyone. If you're looking for a more hands-off
solution, we recommend using the
[Convex-hosted product](https://convex.dev/plans).

## Open Source Convex Backend

The majority of the backend is written in Rust, with a healthy dose of
TypeScript supporting the server-side function environment.

You can learn more about open-sourcing at Convex in our
[announcement](https://news.convex.dev/convex-goes-open-source/) and the
[software engineering daily podcast](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/03/20/going-open-source-at-convex-with-james-cowling/).
It is released under the [FSL Apache 2.0 License](https://fsl.software/).
