This package contains source code to be executed in node (possibly on AWS).

# To run

Run backend locally (eg via `just run-backend`) Deploy code (eg via
`just convex deploy`) Run a function (eg via `just convex run` or by starting up
the UI of a demo and using it) The backend logs emits a `node` command which you
can rerun manually to speed up the edit-test-run loop.
