the goal was to learn from it and sharpen my knowledge, and so i did.
i learned a lot from using cursor as it was the most thing that helped me build this as fast as i did, without having previous knowlegde on how things work.
the idea was simple:
- scrape product informations from an affiliate website "https://sawa9ly.app/"

- using next.js 15 and convex as backend, i then create a complete online store, with categories, product page, checkout page and search, having the product content be the data scraped from the affiliate website's list of products
- add a price margin for each product, and boom, you got yourself an online e-commerce store. 


here is exactly how this web aoo works:
